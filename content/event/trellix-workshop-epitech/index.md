summary: Build an e-market app using React and Django
abstract: "As part of the Learn With [Trellix](https://www.trellix.io/about) program, 
[Wallis Kassiwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walliskassiwin/) and I led a workshop
with the students of [Epitech-BÃ©nin](https://epitech.bj/). This workshop consisted of 
showing how one could 
create a well-structured application from scratch. At the end of the session, we had 
successfully implemented a basic e-market application with React for the front-end and 
Django for the back-end.
