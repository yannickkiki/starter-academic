summary: First Prize at Mapcom Programming Marathon 2019.
abstract: "With my team made up of Jocelin Hounon and Romaric Madegnan, we had the 
immense honor of winning the first prize in a programming competition organized by MAPCOM 
to prepare for the ICPC competition. This competition took place over several days and 
with teams from the West African sub-region. It was very tight but we were able to take 
the first place and I think it's one of the best memories of my student journey.
